Creating a new text file in my test branch via git CMD.

NOTE: To make a new branch, you must use 'git checkout -b <branch name>' to do this from a new branch.

To commit changes, you'll need to do 'git commit -m "changes made to XXXXX"' and that should update/upload your branch and changes to the repo on github.

You can also add extra commits to a file if you forgot something with 'git commit --amend -m "New commit message"'

Once that is added, you then need to do 'git push'
